## Core Requirements
1. Extract images from modern, JavaScript-heavy websites
2. Support format filtering (jpg, png, etc.)
3. Control crawl depth with domain limiting
4. Provide concurrent downloads with robust error handling
5. Handle dynamic image formats (content negotiation)
6. Bypass website access restrictions where possible
7. Extract images from various sources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Project Goals
- Create a reliable, maintainable image crawler
- Support a wide range of website technologies
- Provide clear documentation and examples
- Balance performance with respectful website access
- Implement robust error handling and recovery
- Handle modern web technologies like content negotiation and anti-bot measures
