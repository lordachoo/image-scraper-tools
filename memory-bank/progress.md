# Progress: Website Image Crawler

## What Works
1. **Core Crawling Functionality**:
   - URL traversal with depth control
   - Domain restriction to prevent unbounded crawling
   - Breadth-first search for optimal coverage

2. **Comprehensive Image Extraction**:
   - HTML elements (img tags, srcset attributes)
   - CSS backgrounds and inline styles
   - JavaScript/JSON content in script tags
   - Support for various CDN domains (contentstack.io, etc.)

3. **Advanced Download Features**:
   - Format filtering (jpg, png, etc.)
   - Content-Type verification
   - Format mismatch handling for content negotiation
   - Concurrent downloads with thread pool management
   - Proper file extension handling

4. **Anti-Bot Measures**:
   - Browser-like headers for all requests
   - User-agent rotation to appear more human-like
   - Cloudflare bypass with cloudscraper
   - Domain-specific handling for known protected sites
   - Successfully tested on IMFDB.org and other protected sites

5. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Exponential backoff for transient errors
   - Multiple fallback strategies
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## What's Left to Build
1. **Proxy Support**: 
   - Integration with rotating proxies
   - Proxy list management

2. **Enhanced Rate Limiting**:
   - Domain-specific rate limits
   - Adaptive rate limiting based on response times

3. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - Progress bar for downloads
   - More detailed statistics

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Image similarity detection to avoid duplicates
   - Metadata extraction from images
   - Site-specific optimizations for popular platforms

## Current Status
The crawler is fully functional and successfully handles:
- Modern JavaScript-heavy websites
- Content negotiation (WebP images served as jpg/png)
- Cloudflare-protected sites using cloudscraper
- Format filtering and validation
- Concurrent downloads with appropriate rate limiting

The latest enhancement (Cloudflare bypass) has been successfully tested on IMFDB.org and is working well, allowing access to previously blocked sites.

## Known Issues
1. **Some Advanced Protection**: Very sophisticated anti-bot systems may still block the crawler
2. **JavaScript Limitations**: The regex-based approach may miss some dynamically generated content
3. **Memory Usage**: Large crawls can consume significant memory, especially with high concurrency
4. **URL Encoding**: Some complex URLs with special characters may not be handled correctly

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Initial Approach**: Simple requests-based crawler with basic HTML parsing
2. **Enhancement 1**: Added JavaScript extraction for modern websites
3. **Enhancement 2**: Implemented content negotiation handling for WebP images
4. **Enhancement 3**: Added browser-like headers and user-agent rotation to reduce blocking
5. **Enhancement 4**: Integrated cloudscraper for Cloudflare bypass capability
6. **Future Direction**: Moving toward more sophisticated anti-bot measures and site-specific optimizations
